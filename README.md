# Title: Restaurant Queuing Simulation System

## Team Member(s): Mingwei Gao, Xinhe Peng, Yikai Deng

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:

This is a simulation system to get :
- average waiting time of customers, 
- how many groups of customers are remained,
- and which table does current group of customers is assigned to.

The restaurant has:
- 6 tables for groups of up to two customers, 
- 4 tables for groups of up to four customers, 
- and 2 tables for groups of up to six customers.

Groups would be divided into three queues, based on the number of customers in th groups.


### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). 
For each such variable, how did you decide the range and which probability distribution to use?  
Do you think it's a good representation of reality?
